# Stock Market Insights and AI Advisor

## Project Overview

This MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application provides users with stock market data, recommendations, and an AI-powered chatbot for financial advice. The project aims to help users make informed decisions about their investments by providing up-to-date market information and personalized guidance.

## Features

- User authentication (register/login)
- Real-time stock market data
- Daily stock recommendations
- AI chatbot for financial advice
- Responsive web design

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API requests

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB for data storage
- Mongoose for object modeling
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- OpenAI API for AI chatbot functionality

### Data Scraping
- Cheerio for web scraping
- Axios for making HTTP requests

## How It Works

### Backend

1. **Server Setup**: The `server.js` file sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and defines the main routes.

2. **Authentication**: 
   - Users can register and login using the `/api/auth` routes.
   - `authController.js` handles user registration and login logic.
   - JWT tokens are used for maintaining user sessions.

3. **Stock Data**:
   - The `scraper.js` utility scrapes stock market data and recommendations daily.
   - Scraped data is stored in MongoDB using the `StockRecommendation` and `StockMarket` models.
   - `stockController.js` handles requests for stock data and recommendations.

4. **AI Chatbot**:
   - `chatRoutes.js` defines the endpoints for the chat functionality.
   - `chatController.js` processes user messages and generates responses.
   - `openai.js` utility integrates with the OpenAI API to generate intelligent responses.

5. **Middleware**:
   - `authMiddleware.js` protects routes that require authentication.

### Frontend

1. **App Structure**: `App.js` sets up the main structure of the React application and defines routes.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - `Register.js` and `Login.js` components handle user registration and login.
   - Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is stored for maintaining the user session.

3. **Stock Data Display**:
   - Components (to be implemented) will fetch and display stock market data and recommendations from the backend API.

4. **Chat Interface**:
   - A chat interface component (to be implemented) will allow users to interact with the AI chatbot.
   - Messages are sent to the backend, processed, and responses are displayed to the user.

## Data Flow

1. The scraper runs daily to fetch the latest stock market data and recommendations.
2. Users register or login to access the application.
3. Authenticated users can view stock market data and recommendations fetched from the backend.
4. Users can interact with the AI chatbot, sending messages through the chat interface.
5. The backend processes these messages, using the OpenAI API to generate responses.
6. The AI-generated responses are sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Setup and Installation
